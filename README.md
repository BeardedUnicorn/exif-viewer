# Exif Viewer

A desktop application built with Tauri, React, Vite, TypeScript, and MUI v7 that lets you browse for an image file and inspect its EXIF metadata in a detailed table.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Use the **Browse for image** button to select a photo. The metadata table will update automatically with the EXIF tags extracted from the image.
